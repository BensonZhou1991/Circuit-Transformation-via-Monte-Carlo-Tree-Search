# Circuit Transformation via Monte Carlo Tree Search
 
This repository is a Python implementation for the paper 'A Monte Carlo Tree Search Framework for Quantum Circuit Transformation'.

Readers can run 'Main_MCtree_search.py' to test the relevant algorithm in IBM Q20 architecture.

The necessary packages, 'networkx', 'qiskit', 'matplotlib' and 'numpy', should be installed before running.
