# Circuit Transformation via Monte Carlo Tree Search

Thie repository is currently outdated. Please refer to https://github.com/BensonZhou1991/MCTS-New for the latest implementation and experimental results of our MCTS-based algorithms for Quantum Circuit Transformation.
 
This repository is a Python implementation for the paper 'A Monte Carlo Tree Search Framework for Quantum Circuit Transformation'.

Readers can run 'Main_MCtree_search.py' to test the relevant algorithm in IBM Q20 architecture.

The necessary packages, 'networkx', 'qiskit', 'matplotlib' and 'numpy', should be installed before running.

Notice that this Python implementation is currently not compatible with Linux or Python 3.8.
